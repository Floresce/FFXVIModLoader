![Elden Mod Loader](https://github.com/techiew/EldenRingModLoader/blob/master/header.jpg)
A mod loader for Elden Ring which simply loads all .dlls found in the "mods" folder when the game starts. You can find the mods I've made for the mod loader in this repo: https://github.com/techiew/EldenRingMods

If you want to develop a mod for this, package your code into a .dll and put it into the "mods" folder and it will be loaded. What the code does is up to you.
