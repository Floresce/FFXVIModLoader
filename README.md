![Elden Mod Loader](https://github.com/techiew/EldenRingModLoader/blob/master/header.jpg)
A mod loader for Elden Ring which simply loads all .dlls found in the "mods" folder.

Currently the only mod that is made to be used with the loader is my "[Fix the camera](https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/118)" mod.
